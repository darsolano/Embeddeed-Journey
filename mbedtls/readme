+# mbedTLS
 
+mbedTLS is the lightweight TLS/SSL and cryptography library used in this project to
+secure network communications on resource-constrained devices. It provides the
+core security building blocks—TLS handshakes, certificate validation, encryption,
+message integrity, and key management—that allow the rest of the stack to create
+trusted, authenticated, and encrypted connections.
+
+## Role in secured connected projects
+
+mbedTLS enables secure transport for common IoT and embedded protocols, including:
+
+- **MQTTS (MQTT over TLS)**
+  - Establishes a TLS session between the device and the broker.
+  - Verifies broker certificates (or uses mutual TLS with client certificates).
+  - Protects MQTT payloads from eavesdropping and tampering.
+
+- **HTTPS**
+  - Wraps HTTP traffic in TLS to provide confidentiality and integrity.
+  - Ensures the device is communicating with the legitimate server through
+    certificate validation.
+
+- **Secure WebSocket (wss://)**
+  - Uses the same TLS primitives as HTTPS to secure WebSocket upgrades and
+    bidirectional messaging.
+
+- **REST API clients**
+  - Secures REST requests/responses over HTTPS.
+  - Enables authentication patterns such as mutual TLS when required by the API.
+
+## Why it matters for embedded systems
+
+- **Footprint-friendly**: optimized for limited RAM/flash budgets.
+- **Configurable**: compile-time options let you enable only the required ciphers
+  and features.
+- **Portable**: runs across a wide range of MCU/RTOS environments.
+
+In short, mbedTLS is the security foundation that allows the networking examples
+in this repository to communicate safely with cloud services and brokers.
